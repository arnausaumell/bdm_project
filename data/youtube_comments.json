        "text": "Man, what a tragic misfire. The Electric State had the potential to be something truly special, something quiet, melancholic, and deeply atmospheric, just like Simon St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s original work. But instead of embracing the eerie stillness and emotional weight of the source material, Netflix chose to turn it into yet another action-heavy, color-graded spectacle that completely misses the point.<br><br>The original Electric State isn\u2019t just a story, it\u2019s an experience. It\u2019s about silence, decay, and a world collapsing not with a bang, but with a whisper. St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s art doesn\u2019t need explosions or forced tension to be haunting, it\u2019s haunting because of its restraint. The film, on the other hand, takes all that subtlety and throws it out the window. Instead of a meditative journey through a dying world, we get... well, just another generic sci-fi blockbuster.<br><br>And the worst part? This wasn\u2019t inevitable. It was a choice. A choice to prioritize spectacle over substance. A choice to cater to the lowest common denominator instead of trusting the audience to appreciate nuance. A choice to take something unique and make it marketable instead of meaningful. And what makes it even more frustrating is that we know it could\u2019ve been done right, because Tales from the Loop proved it. That series took another one of St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s works and adapted it with care, with artistic integrity, and with the emotional depth it deserved. So the argument that The Electric State was \u201ctoo difficult\u201d to adapt properly? That\u2019s just not true. It could\u2019ve been done. They just didn\u2019t want to.<br><br>What we got isn\u2019t just a disappointing adaptation, it\u2019s a perfect example of how Hollywood strips art of its soul in favor of engagement metrics and broad appeal. And in doing so, they didn\u2019t just make a bad movie. They erased something beautiful.<br> The Russo Brothers should be removed from Hollywood, for commiting such an act of disrespect.",

I&#39;ve loved much of the Russo Brothers&#39; work since seeing it in Community (Winter Soldier&#39;s my favorite Marvel movie, by a long shot), with their deft combination of character, action, and wit. And I fell in love with Simon St\u00e5lenhag&#39;s work since I first stumbled across a painting of his. But this is the precise opposite of the vibe I get from St\u00e5lenhag&#39;s imagery. I adore how St\u00e5lenhag depicts a sense of loneliness, the wan Scandinavian light, the commonplace acceptance of imagery that in another illustrator&#39;s work would evoke naive awe.<br><br>Tales From The Loop actually managed to capture some of that St\u00e5lenhag vibe; this trailer feels profoundly false and glib, a bad joke. It&#39;s not so much peanut butter and chocolate, as aquavit and Marshmallow fluff. Honestly, I wish both the Russo Brothers and St\u00e5lenhag great success at everything they do, but I also wish the two had never met, based on this.",

This means the plot is openly discussed because they expect you to be dumb or not watching and the writting is awful because they just don&#39;t care. The only thing they care is to get 2-3 superstars in the cast to create a &quot;good&quot; trailer and make you want to renew your subscription. That&#39;s it, that&#39;s Netflix.",
